# Regional Similarity

### An Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis Tool 

This tool helps you explore the similarities between different counties in the United States. The color scheme in the legend represents the [Jensen-Shannon Distance (JSD)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon.html) between counties based on the [Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM)](https://github.com/google-research/population-dynamics):

- **Darker colors** indicate smaller JSDs, meaning the counties are more similar.
- **Lighter colors** indicate larger JSDs, meaning the counties are less similar.

Use the map to navigate and compare regions. Click on a county to view its comparative similarities with other counties. Hover over each county to see the associated data.
